# Address Normalization Providers Analysis
## For Bulk Processing (Millions of Addresses)

### Your Use Case
You need to normalize millions of addresses to create consistent, comparable versions for deduplication. Example:
- "123 Main Street 90210"
- "123 Main St Beverly Hills 90210" 
- "123 MAIN ST BEVERLY HILLS"

All should return: "123 Main Street Beverly Hills, CA 90210"

3. **Volume discounts** - Negotiate enterprise pricing for large volumes
4. **Hybrid approach** - Use free services for initial filtering

### **Technical Implementation:**
- Most providers offer REST APIs

## Next Steps

1. **Contact providers** for exact pricing based on your volume
2. **Request sample data** to test accuracy
3. **Evaluate API documentation** and integration complexity
4. **Consider hybrid approaches** (e.g., free services for initial filtering)
5. **Test with a subset** of your data before committing
